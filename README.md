## Looking forward

There's still some decision making to be done on what exactly will be considered basic-level requirements for a theme. There's a good chance it will be somewhat based on the [ComomonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/). 

Also, it seems that there will be a need second level of requirements for the more ambitious designers. Perhaps these could be based on the [HTML5 Semantic Entities.](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) That's a much more opinionated area, though so it'll be
