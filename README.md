# Quick Brown Fox

## What is it?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog):

> **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"** is an English-language pangramâ€”a sentence that contains all of the letters of the alphabet. It is commonly used for touch-typing practice, testing typewriters and computer keyboards, displaying examples of fonts, and other applications involving text where the use of all letters in the alphabet is desired.
 
It's that, except for HTML.

## Quickstart

### 1) Install

```bash
# Clone this repo.
git clone https://github.com/foundations-dev/quick-brown-fox.git
```

```bash
# Serve the HTML
cd quick-brown-fox
npx serve
```

Open `localhost:5000` in your browser (assuming that's the port being served)

###  2) Add Styles

**Method 1 -** Replace `index.css` with your custom CSS.

**Method 2 -** In `index.html`, replace `line 9` with a URL linking to your styles. There are several examples within `index.html` if you want to try out some popular CSS packages&mdash;just uncomment those lines.


## Overview 

This was built because there isn't a standard HTML file to help make sure a fledgling design system covers all the basic styling needs of a fully-themed web page. If your design system is worth its salt, we believe that, at a minimum, it should make this page look okay, **without** the need for any classes. 

Currently, this page adds the following inline css for the sake of legibility. It may not stay this way, but rest assured, any changes will be carefully considered.

```css
body {
   max-width: 80ch;
   margin: 100px auto;
}
```

You can use this page in any way you find helpful. If you don't know how to link the HTML to your CSS, there's plenty of tutorials on the web. We will consider adding some more guidance here if there's interest.

## HTML Tags

These are the HTML tags that we currently support:

- `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`
- `p`, `strong`(bold), `em`(italic)
- `ul`, `ol`, `li`
- `blockquote > p`
- `pre > code`
- `table`, `thead`, `tr`, `th`, `tbody`
- `form`, `input`, `textarea`, `button` 

(There are more tags currently visible on the page, but they may be removed at a later date. It's important we try to keep this lean, and allow options for expansion. See next section.) 



## Looking forward

There's still some decision making to be done on what exactly will be considered basic-level requirements for a theme. There's a good chance it will be somewhat based on the [ComomonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/). 

Also, it seems that there will be a need second level of requirements for the more ambitious designers. Perhaps these could be based on the [HTML5 Semantic Entities.](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) That's a much more opinionated area, though so it'll be considered at a later date.
